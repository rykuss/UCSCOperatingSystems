# UCSCOperatingSystems
All of my work from "CMPS 111: Operating Systems", an advanced intro course that required high skill level for Operating Systems.
I'm uploading my work from this class for professional reasons, so that an employer or otherwise may see how I think.

There were five HW's that are primarily pseudo-code and reasoning based. I cannot guarantee the correctness of any of the solutions.

There were also three labs, each of which dabbled in the Pintos OS. We ran tests on our code changes through a timeshare system
at UCSC. Make sure to read the README in each of the Labs for a Table of Contents.
